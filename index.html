               Before the Incident
            </h2>
               <P>
                  When I was young it was just my mother and I living in a one bedroom appartment in Philadelphia.
                  I didn't see her much back then. With her working two jobs just to put food on the table, I was 
                  left to spend most of my days on the playground where our only mentor...was the streets.
                  At the time life seemed like hardship but I can only look back at the memories fondly now. Even
                  considering...the incident.
               </P>

               The Incident
            </h2>
               <p>
                  Gang presence in the neighborhood was no secret. Most of us tried our best to avoid them but sometimes fate chooses for you.
                  One day me and my friends were shootin' some b-ball outside of the school when a loose ball bumped into a couple of 
                  guys hanging out at the court. It was clear to see they were up to no-good and something as small as a basketball was enough to
                  set them off. Before we knew it they were on us like white on rice. One of them even hoisted me up on his shoulders and spun me
                  around like a top. Beaten and humiliated I walked home. My mother broke down upon seeing the bruises and black eyes. I tried to 
                  explain to her it was just one little fight but she was so scared for my safety by the next morning my bags were packed, plane
                  ticket in hand to my uncle and auntie's place in California.

               After the Incident
            </h2>
               <p id = "greenParagraph">
                  Now my Uncle Phil and Auntie Viv had done very well for themselves over the years. So well in fact they had bought me a first
                  class ticket to LAX. I was on that plane drinking orange juice from a champagne glass, livin' large. Until then I was dreading
                  being the fish out of water with all these pompous and pretentious rich folk but now, I'm starting to like the idea. As soon as
                  we landed I hopped in cab (which smelled kinda funny) and I couldn't believe my eyes when we pulled up, this place looke JUST like
                  the White House! I said smell ya later to the cab driver and walked up to the door feeling like royalty. I was finally home in Bel Air.
